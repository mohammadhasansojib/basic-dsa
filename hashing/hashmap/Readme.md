# Hashing implementation using HashMap in Java

## Overview
The HashMap data structure store data like the actucal value as a key and frequency of the key as a value in HashMap. So that it can be find easily in an array that which value appear how many times.


## Technical aspects
### classes
* Main - 
- `main`: main method does all the initialization, display, method calling etc.
- `compute`: compute method compute the frequency for each item of the array and store in HashMap as key, value pair. Array item as key & frequency as value.
- `arrayInput`: arrayInput method take input and store the value in array.
